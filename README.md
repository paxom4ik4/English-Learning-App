# RS Lang
This app was created as a final project on the RSS course (Frontend/JS).

Technologies:  
- ReactJS

This app allows you to learn English with Anki system. Based on regular repetition of words. The repetition interval depends on the knowledge of a particular word. 

This project helped me figure out what to work in a team. Introduced react / redux 

My responsibilities included the development of the main page and adding functionality to it.
